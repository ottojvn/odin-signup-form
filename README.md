# Odin Sign-up Form

The main objective of this project is using forms in general, but in particular (for my project at least) form validation:
  - verify that password match a certain pattern, and indicate what parts of the pattern it is matching or not (your browser should be able to render emojis for this part)
  - verify that password and password confirmation match eachother and indicate the user if they don't
